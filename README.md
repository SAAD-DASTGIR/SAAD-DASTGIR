## üëã About Me

I am a Computer Science graduate from Bahria University, Islamabad, with a deep passion for full-stack web development. My technical expertise lies in the MERN and MEAN stacks, along with strong proficiency in tools and technologies like Git, Strapi, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS services, including VPC, IAM, EC2, S3, RDS, ECS, EKS, CloudFront, and DynamoDB.

Currently, I am working as a Full-Stack Web Developer at TakDevs Private Limited, where I handle various projects using AngularJS, NodeJS, Strapi, and PostgreSQL. My day-to-day activities involve enterprise-standard frontend development using Angular & MUI, and custom backend development of REST APIs using Strapi. Prior to this role, I served as an Associate Software Developer at DevVerse IT Solutions, where I specialized in web development using the MERN stack and focused on deployment using AWS.

I am also a technical blogger, sharing insights and the latest developments in the software industry. Outside of work, I enjoy delving into history, world politics, international relations, theology, and cultural studies, exploring how these elements influence our modern world. Additionally, I have a deep love for reading, whether it's books or the stories of people around me.
